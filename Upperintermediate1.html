This collection of Poe's work contains some of the 
most exciting and haunting stories ever written. 
They range from the poetic to the mysterious to 
the darkly comic, yet all possess the genius for 
the grotesque that defines Poe's writing. They are 
peopled with neurotics and social outcasts, obsessed 
with nameless terrors or preoccupied with seemingly 
unsolvable mysteries. 'The Fall of the House of 
Usher' is a key work in the horror canon, while in 
the 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue', we find the 
origins of modern detective fiction. Collectively, 
these tales represent the best of Edgar Allan Poe's 
prose work before his premature death in 1849." onmouseover="this.width=155;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=160;this.height=190" width="160" height="190"></a></td>

and Walter Morel has become a battleground. 
Repelled by her uneducated and violent husband,

children, especially to her sons, William and 
Paul - determined they will not follow their 
father into working down the coal mines. But 
conflict is evitable when Paul seeks to escape
