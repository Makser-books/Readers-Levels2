Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the 
Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous 
account by English writer Jerome K. Jerome 
of a two-week boating holiday on the Thames 
from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back 
to Kingston. The book was initially intended 
to be a serious travel guide, with accounts 
of local history along the route, but the 
humorous elements took over to the point 
where the serious and somewhat sentimental 
passages seem a distraction to the comic 
novel. One of the most praised things about 
Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears
