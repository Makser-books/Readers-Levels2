Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the 
Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous 
account by English writer Jerome K. Jerome 
of a two-week boating holiday on the Thames 
from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford and back

to be a serious travel guide, with accounts 
of local history along the route, but the 
humorous elements took over to the point

passages seem a distraction to the comic
