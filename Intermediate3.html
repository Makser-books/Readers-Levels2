Jack loves Gwendolen and Algernon loves Cecily. 
Both girls believe their men are called Ernest. 
That's a good thing because they won't marry 
anybody who isn't called Ernest. There are more 
problems. Gwendolen's mother, Lady Bracknell, 
doesn't think Jack is a suitable husband for 
her daughter. He was abandoned as a baby, and 
therefore knows nothing about his real family. 
Jack, who is Cecily's guardian, won't allow 
her to marry Algernon unless he can marry 
Gwendolen. Can the couples overcome the 
difficulties and get married in the end? And
