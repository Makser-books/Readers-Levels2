Parents said goodbye to their children. Husbands kissed their 
wives for the last time. One woman's husband told her, "You 
go. I will stay." The lifeboat left, and she never saw him again. 
There were many examples of bravery on the Titanic  on the 
night of April 14, 1912. Some of the crew and passengers 
worked all night to save other people. They chose to stay on the 
ship until the end. Other passengers thought only about saving 
themselves. They fought to get into the lifeboats. 
Some people think that the Titanic showed people at their best 
and at their worst. Maybe this is why the disaster is still 
famous. The ship sank in the North Atlantic over seventy-five 
years ago. But almost everybody in the world today knows the 
name of the Titanic.
 
So what really happened that night? Why did the ship hit an 
iceberg? Why didn't another ship save the passengers? How 
many people survived, and how many died?
 
You will find the answers in this book. But remember that the 
disaster is more than just a story in a history book. It happened 
a long time ago, but some old people today can still remember 
it. There were many kinds of people on the ship—rich and poor, 
young and old. Each person had hopes and dreams. When the 
ship sank, hundreds died. Their hopes and dreams died with 
them.

     <text><![CDATA[The king of the world! 
James Cameron was the big winner at Oscar night in Los 
Angeles in March 1998. His 1997 movie was named Best 
Picture, winning ten other Oscars, too. As Cameron held up the 
Oscar, he repeated a famous line from the movie: "I'm the king 
of the world!" He later joked that "size does matter." 
  It was a dream that Cameron had for a long time. He loved 
history and he was always interested in the story of the Titanic. 
Cameron's early movies—for example, The Terminator and 
Aliens—were full of action. Titanic had plenty of action, too, 
but the heart of the movie was a love story. Cameron chose 
 
two young actors for this.
Leonardo DiCaprio played Jack Dawson. Born in 1974, 
DiCaprio was first seen on TV at the age of five. He became 
famous in the 1990s with movies like What's Eating Gilbert 
Grape? and This Boy's Life. Work on Cameron's Titanic was long 
and difficult for DiCaprio.
 
Kate Winslet played Jack's lover, Rose. The British actress was 
also born in 1974. Winslet was not interested in small parts in 
Hollywood movies. She wanted to act in the theater. But soon 
Kate was in the biggest movie that was ever made.
 
While Cameron was making the movie, not everybody was so 
sure about its success. It took a long time to make the movie. As 
it continued, the cost went up and up. It finally cost between 
$185,000,000 and $200,000,000. The movie's opening was 
changed from summer of 1997 to December. Many newspapers 
and magazines wrote stories about the movie like "Titanic 
Sinks."

     <text><![CDATA[Titanic was more expensive than any other movie: 
? For the first part, Cameron filmed the real Titanic at the 
bottom of the ocean. He had to go down to the ship in a 
submarine twelve times. 
? Cameron filmed most of the movie on a model that was 
almost as big as the Titanic. He wanted everything on the 
ship to be like the real Titanic.  Clothes, furniture, 
machines—everything had to be exactly right. 
Not all newspapers and magazines liked the movie. One called it 
"dead in the water." But people around the world loved it. The 
world's most expensive movie became the biggest success. It 
earned over $1,600,000,000!

     <text><![CDATA[The Biggest Ship in 
The biggest and the best! 
In the 1900s, more and more people wanted to travel across the 
Atlantic Ocean. The ships became bigger and better, as ship 
companies fought hard for customers. In 1907, the White Star 
Line decided to build the biggest and the best of all. The 
company planned to make three ships. Their names said a lot 
about them—Olympic, Titanic, and Gigantic. 
Next to the Titanic, most other ships seemed small. It was 269 
meters (882 feet) long. At the time, the tallest building in the 
 
world was only 229 meters (750 feet).
 
LIFEBOATS 
 
There were twenty lifeboats on
the ship.
 
COMPARTMENTS
 
 
 
There were sixteen compartments
on the ship.

Everyone thought that the ship was also very safe. There were 
sixteen compartments. In an accident, big metal doors could 
close and then no water could get from one compartment to 
another. The ship was even able to float with the first 4 
compartments full of water! 
The  Titanic  became the famous "unsinkable ship." Nobody 
seemed to worry about another important fact. The ship could 
carry more than 3,000 passengers, but it only had lifeboats for 
1,178 people. 
 
                             BRIDGE 
The ship's bridge gave the captain 
and officers a good view. 
DECKS 
The ship had nine different decks. 
The top one was the boat deck.

     <text><![CDATA["That ship is going to sink!" 
Can some people see the future? Can dreams ever show what 
is going to happen? A few strange things happened before 
the Titanic sailed for the first time in 1912. 
Strange Books 
? In 1898, "Morgan Robertson wrote a book called Futility, or 
The Wreck on the Titan. The book told the story of a ship 
crossing the Atlantic. It hit an iceberg and sank. Almost all 
of the passengers died because there weren't enough 
lifeboats. 
? Six years earlier, in 1892, William T. Stead wrote From the 
Old World to the New. In that story, too, a ship hit an 
iceberg and sank. Another ship picked up the survivors. 
The captain's name was E. J. Smith—the name of the 
Titanic's captain. Twenty years later, Stead traveled on the 
real Titanic. He didn't survive. 
Dreams and Bad Feelings 
? The Adelmans were planning to return to America on the 
Titanic. Suddenly, Mrs. Adelman had a terrible feeling of 
danger. She and her husband didn't travel on the Titanic. 
? Mrs. Blanche Marshall watched the Titanic from an island 
near Southampton. "That ship is going to sink before it 
reaches America," she said. "1 can see hundreds of people in 
the icy water." 
The Titanic left Southampton, on the south coast of England, 
at noon on April 10, 1912. Even at the start of the trip, the 
Titanic had bad luck. There was almost an accident in the first 
minutes of the trip. 
The danger passed, but for some people this was a bad 
start to the famous ship's first trip across the Atlantic. Some 
people said, "It's bad luck!"

  Because the 
Titanic was so big, 
the New York was 
pulled closer toward 
it. The ropes broke 
on the smaller ship. 
It began to float 
 
toward the Titanic.
  Luckily, a small

boat was able to tie               
a rope onto the                     
New York. It pulled                   
the smaller ship out       
 
of the way.
At this time of year, there was also a danger of icebergs in the 
North Atlantic. But the Titanic's captain, Edward Smith, wasn't 
really worried about ice—this was the unsinkable Titanic!

     <text><![CDATA[The Queen of the Ocean 
The  Titanic  was able to carry more than 3,000 people, but 
there were only 2,207 people on the ship for its first trip. 
 
     First class: 322 passengers 
Second class: 275 passengers                                 
    Third class: 712 passengers 
              Crew: 898 people                                          
The different classes didn't mix on the ship. They slept, lived, 
and ate on different decks. Of course, the first-class 
passengers were on the higher decks. The second-class 
passengers were in the middle. Then came the third-class 
passengers, at the bottom. 
First Class 
The White Star Line called the Titanic  "the Queen of the 
Ocean." For first-class passengers, life on the Titanic was as 
comfortable as life in the most expensive hotels in Europe and 
America. There were hundreds of servants to look after them. 
Their private rooms were large and comfortable. They could 
enjoy a swimming pool, a library, Turkish baths, and excellent 
restaurants and bars. 
Some of the richest people in the world were on the ship. In 
fact, American John Jacob Astor IV was possibly the richest of 
all. In 1912 he had $87 million. (That is more than 
 
$1,500,000,000 today.)
Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line and 
 
Thomas Andrews, the ship's builder, were also on the Titanic.
Second Class 
Life for the passengers in second class was comfortable, too. In 
fact, second class on the Titanic was as nice as first-class travel 
on many other ships. These passengers also had a library and a 
few bars. They, too, could walk around on an open deck and 
enjoy views of the ocean.

Life was as comfortable as the life in the most expensive hotels. 
Third Class 
More than half of the passengers were in third class. Of 
course, life on these decks wasn't as comfortable. But the 
rooms were clean and bright. 
More than 100 of the third-class passengers were from 
Ireland. The others came from many different countries in 
Europe. Most of them had the same dream. They were leaving 
their problems in their own countries. For them, the United 
States of America was the promise of a new life.

     <text><![CDATA[The "Unsinkable 
On Sunday, April 14, while the passengers enjoyed life on the 
Titanic, radio operators Jack Phillips and Harold Bride were busy. 
Many passengers wanted to send personal messages to friends and 
relatives on land. But Phillips and Bride were receiving messages 
from other ships also. 
 
Early in the afternoon, Phillips received an ice warning from 
a ship called the Baltic. It was the third warning of the day. 
The message was taken to the bridge, but Captain Smith 
didn't show it to his officers until 7:15 . .  P M
   
It was a cold, clear evening now. Seeing the message about 
ice, Second Officer Lightoller told the lookouts to watch 
carefully for icebergs. 
  
In the radio room, Jack Phillips took another message about 
icebergs ahead. It never reached the bridge. Phillips put it 
down on his desk and continued with his work. 
  
Phillips received another message. This one was from a ship 
called the Californian. The ship couldn't move through the 
ice. "Shut up, shut up," Philips said. "I'm busy." 
  
Lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were cold and 
tired. Suddenly, Fleet saw a large, black shape in the ocean. 
He rang the warning three times and telephoned the bridge. 
"Iceberg right ahead," he told Sixth Officer James 
Moody.

     <text><![CDATA[Ship" Sinks 
  On the bridge, First Officer William Murdoch had to act fast. 
He turned the ship left, hoping to miss the iceberg. he also 
ordered the crew to stop the ship. 
The iceberg was thirty meters higher than the top decks. 
Some ice fell onto the deck as the ship passed it. But 
nothing broke. It was a different story under the water. The 
iceberg hit the side of the ship, making a few long holes 
below the water. Many passengers heard the noise, but it 
wasn't very loud. Nobody knew it yet, but this was the 
beginning of the end for the Titanic. 
 
Captain Smith hurried to the bridge. 
"What have we hit?" he asked Murdoch. 
"An iceberg, sir," replied the First Officer. 
Soon Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line was on the 
bridge, too. Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall went to check 
the lower decks. Fifteen minutes later, he reported, "Water 
is coming in." 
  
Captain Smith and the ship's builder, Thomas Andrews, 
went below to check. Andrews immediately understood the 
terrible danger. The ship could float with water in the four 
compartments at the front, but there was water in five of 
the compartments. There was no hope. The Titanic  was 
sinking. 
There was only one thing that Captain Smith could do now. 
Just after midnight, he ordered the crew to prepare the 
lifeboats.

     <text><![CDATA[“Women and children first!” 
After Smith gave the order, the crew started to wake the 
passengers. They told them to put on their lifebelts and warm 
clothes. Passengers should go to the boat deck. 
At first, many of them didn't believe the danger—of course, the 
Titanic  couldn't sink! Some of the first lifeboats were almost 
empty. There were twelve people in one boat for seventy people. 
As the front end of the Titanic sank lower and lower in the 
water, more passengers began to understand the danger. But they 
still didn't know the most terrible fact of all. There were more than 
2,200 people on the Titanic, but the ship had lifeboats for only 
1,178! 
Parents said goodbye to their children. Husbands kissed their 
wives for the last time. One woman's husband told her, "You go. 1 
will stay." The lifeboat left, and she never saw him again. 
? First-class passenger "Molly Brown was put into the third 
lifeboat and she helped to get the boat away from the ship. 
Later, she saved a dying man, keeping him warm with her coat. 
? An old woman, Mrs. Ida Straus, decided not to go into a 
lifeboat. She couldn't leave her husband. "We have lived 
together and we will die together," she said. 
? One man put on women's clothes and tried to get into a 
lifeboat. The officer sent him away angrily. 
? Third-class passenger Minnie Coutts didn't have enough 
lifebelts for her two sons. One of the crew gave his lifebelt to 
her. "There!" he said. "If the boat goes down, you'll remember 
me!"

By one o'clock, the danger was clear to everybody.

officers had a different problem. They had to keep people 
away. Guns were given to the officers on the boat deck.

     <text><![CDATA[“Come Quick!” 
While the crew began to fill the lifeboats, radio operators Jack 
Phillips and Harold Bride began to send messages for help. 
Their message was CQD—"Come quick, danger." 
At first Phillips and Bride weren't worried. They 
even made jokes as they worked. 
"You'll see your first iceberg," said Phillips with 
a laugh. 
"The Americans will enjoy it," answered Bride. 
"They all like to have ice in their drinks." 
The first replies came from ships that were too far away. Then 
Phillips heard from the Carpathia. The ship was traveling from 
New York to the Mediterranean. The Carpathian's  radio 
operator, Cyril Evans, couldn't hide his surprise. He 
immediately told Arthur Rostron, the captain of the Carpathia. 
Then he called the Titanic again. The Carpathia was turning 
around. It was coming to help. But there was a problem. The 
Carpathia was about ninety-three kilometers (58 miles) away. 
It could reach the Titanic in four hours. That was too long—the 
Titanic had less than two hours. 
Mow Phillips and Bride understood the danger. They 
continued to send messages, hoping to find a closer ship. The 
Titanic was becoming noisier and their job became harder and 
harder. 
As they worked, Phillips and Bride started sending the new 
help message, SOS. The Titanic was the first ship that sent an 
SOS message. It was quicker and easier to send.

What was the ship that was so close? Why didn't it help? 
? Some people think that it was the Californian. In fact, the 
crew of the Californian did see lights in the sky and the 
lights of a ship. But the ship seemed quite small to them. 
When they tried to send a message to it, there was no 
answer. 
? Did the officers on the Titanic see a different ship? More 
and more people today think that it was a Norwegian 
fishing boat. Why didn't it help? Maybe it was breaking the 
law by being in the area.

After one o'clock on the morning of April 15, the Titanic's

were on. But everyone knew what was happening. And there 
were few lifeboats left. 
? A fourteen- or fifteen-year-old boy tried to hide on a 
lifeboat. The ship's officer pointed a gun at him. "Be a 
man," he said. The boy left the lifeboat. 
? When one lifeboat hit the water, its ropes were still joined 
to the ship. Before it could get away, another lifeboat began 
to come down on top of it. Luckily, a crewman cut the 
ropes with a knife in time. 
Was it true? 
Many people believe that the third-class passengers were kept 
away from the boat decks. It is true that many of these 
 
passengers lost their lives.
Some of the crew did try to help the third-class passengers 
to the boats. The job wasn't easy. Passengers had to go up the 
ship's many decks. Many of them didn't speak English. They 
didn't understand the danger. Some refused to follow the crew 
and stayed on their deck. 
Some doors were locked by the crew. Nobody really knows 
why. Were they following orders? Were they just afraid? But 
women and children from third class were sent to the boat 
deck. The most crowded lifeboat left at 1:25  . . with seventy A M  
people in it. Most of them were women and children from 
third class. But the men were still kept away from the boat 
deck. When they reached it at last, it was too late. Almost all 
the lifeboats were gone.

crew were preparing the next lifeboat, a crowd tried to climb 
into it. Second Officer Lightoller stopped them by waving his 
gun. The crew made a wall with their bodies while women and 
children got into the boat. 
Now only two small lifeboats were left. Each boat could 
hold forty-seven people. They were still tied to a roof on the 
deck.
 
While the crew tried to free these last boats Captain Smith 
shouted to them, "Well, boys, do your best for the women and 
children!" Then he told them to save themselves.
 
There were still more than 1,500 people on the ship. Many of 
 
them looked for ways to survive. Others prepared to die.
? First-class passenger Benjamin Guggenheim came on deck in his 
dinner suit. "We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to 
go down like gentlemen," he said. 
? At around 2:10 A.M., Wallace Hartley told the musicians in his 
band to save themselves. All eight musicians chose to stay with 
Hartley, and they played a final song together. 
Suddenly, the front of the ship moved more quickly down 
into the water. A big wave began to move up the boat deck. 
The end was here.

The deck was getting steeper and steeper. It was impossible to 
stand. There was a terrible crashing noise as furniture and 
plates fell. Many people were thrown into the water. Others 
jumped, hoping to swim to a lifeboat. 
Radio operator Harold Bride was one of the men who were 
trying to free the last lifeboats. As the great wave came up the 
deck, one boat floated away on the water upside-down. More 
than twenty men climbed on top of it, but Bride was under the 
boat and he couldn't escape. For forty-five minutes, he held 
onto the boat in the freezing water. 
In the great ship's final minutes, the lights went out. There 
was no moon that night, but some light came from the stars in 
the clear, dark sky. Suddenly, there was a new noise. This was 
the loudest of all and it could only mean one thing. The ship 
was breaking in two. People were still falling. Others chose to 
jump now. One passenger spoke of the last seconds as the ship 
sank: 
"Slowly . . . the water seemed to come up toward us . .. It 
seemed a dream." 
At 2:20 on the morning of April 15, the "Queen of the 
Ocean" was gone. 
At first, the people in the lifeboats were most afraid for 
their own lives. One crewman shouted, "Pull for your lives." 
But they had to decide what to do. The Titanic was gone and 
hundreds of people were in the icy water of the North 
Atlantic. Some were holding onto furniture. Others were 
trying to swim. Many were screaming for help. To the people 
in the lifeboats, the noise seemed to fill the night.

The people in the lifeboats listened to all those cries for help. 
Imagine the terrible discussions. 
You sit in the lifeboat. The cold is terrible. But you know that 
it is much, much worse for the people in the black water. You 
can hear their screams in the dark. 
"They can't stay alive in the freezing water," says a man in 
the boat. "It's too cold." 
"Our friends and relatives are dying!" shouts a woman 
holding a small child. "My husband stayed on the ship. We 
have to go back and help." 
The crewman shakes his head. "We can't. If we go back, 
too many people will try to get into the boat. Then, we'll all 
die." 
"We have to save ourselves now!" agrees a man at the 
back of the boat. He is crying as he speaks. 
You listen in silence. The screams are becoming quieter, 
as the people in the water become weaker and weaker. Soon 
it will be too late. 
What do you think? What was the right thing to do? 
 
In fact, only one of the lifeboats did go back. Fifth Officer 
Harold Lowe ordered a search for survivors, but it was too 
late. When they arrived most people were dead. Only twelve 
people were pulled from the water. 
One of the people in the water that night was young Jack 
Thayer.

When be received the Titanic’s SOS message in the night, 
Captain Rostron of the Carpathia ordered his ship to go as 
fast as possible. There was a lot of ice in the area. But 
Rostron was a good captain. The Carpathia  saw a rocket 
A M
from one of the lifeboats at 4  . .—less than two hours 
after the Titanic sank. 
It wasn’t easy to find all of the survivors. The lifeboats 
covered a 6.5 kilometer (4-mile) area. It took Rostron and his 
crew four hours to pick up everybody. People in the boats 
waved and shouted. Some burned letters and papers so the 
Carpathia could see them. 
Captain Rostron ordered his crew to count the survivors. 
They counted 705. Later, people guessed 711 or even 757 
survivors. That meant that more than 1,500 of the Titanic’s 
passengers and crew died.

At first, as the Carpathia  traveled back to New York, no 
messages were sent to the waiting world. Some newspapers, 
still believing in the “unsinkable” ship, got the story 
completely wrong. In their news stories, the Titanic was safe 
and all the passengers were alive. 
When the news was finally known, sadness and surprise were 
felt around the world. Ten thousand people were waiting when 
the  Carpathia  arrived in New York on the evening of 
Thursday, April 18. Through newspapers and radio, the eyes of 
the world were on the ship and its survivors. 
Even after the terrible accident, things were very different 
for first-class and third-class passengers. The survivors from 
first-class were taken to the best hotels in New York. But the 
passengers from third-class were in a new country without any 
money or clothes, or any of their things. 
Back in the North Atlantic, a ship was picking up dead bodies 
from the ocean. In the next six weeks, 328 bodies were found. 
The crew of the Mackay-Bennet didn’t know who most of them 
were. But they did know John Jacob Astor IV, possibly the 
richest man in the world. He was carrying a big gold ring, a gold 
watch, and a lot of money when he died. None of it helped 
him. 
In Britain and the US, people were angry about the disaster.            
Many questions were asked. 
?Why didn’t Captain Smith act on warnings about ice?                
?Why did Bruce Ismay survive when his passengers died?               
?Why didn’t the Californian help when they saw rockets?                
?Did a Norwegian fishing ship turn away from the Titanic?                 
?Why weren’t there lifeboats for all the passengers?

One of the strangest stories was the Titanic's  mystery children. 
When the ship was going down, a man passed his two young sons 
into the last lifeboat. The father, "Louis Hoffman," didn't survive. 
The boys arrived in New York on the Carpathia. But nobody knew 
who they were. No family was found. 
In fact, "Louis Hoffman" wasn't the father's real name. It was 
Michel Navratil. Navratil took the boys from their mother in France 
and decided to start a new life with them in America. He didn't 
want their mother to know. Finally, the mother saw her sons in a 
newspaper, and the boys were sent back to France. There they 
told her their father's last words: "Tell her that I loved her and 
still do."

Alice Cleaver was a nurse, traveling on the Titanic  with a 
family in first class. The Allisons didn't know that, years 
earlier, Alice killed her own child. But now, she was helping to 
look after the Allisons' two children, Trevor and Loraine. 
On the night of the accident, the Allisons went on deck. 
Alice Cleaver acted quickly. She picked up the baby, Trevor. "I 
won't let him out of my arms," she told the boy's mother. Then 
she left and found a lifeboat. 
After she got on the Carpathia,  she kept Trevor Allison 
with her. All the newspapers called her very brave. But the 
Allison family thought that Trevor's parents died on the ship 
because they were looking for their son. Their other baby, 
Loraine, died with them. Was Alice Cleaver using Trevor to 
save herself? It is true that people with babies got into 
lifeboats more easily. 
Years later, the mystery about Alice Cleaver and the Allison 
family became even stranger. In 1940, an American woman, 
Loraine Kramer, spoke on the radio. Her story was hard to 
believe. She was Loraine Allison! This was her story: 
A man on the Titanic carried her into a lifeboat. This man 
was the ship's builder, Thomas Andrews! He and Loraine lived 
together in America. Sometimes Bruce Ismay, the president of 
the White Star Line, visited them. He wanted them to hide 
because they knew important secrets about the Titanic. 
Kramer was probably not Loraine Allison. She was probably 
looking for money. In fact, many people think that Alice 
Cleaver helped her with information about the real Loraine 
Allison. 
Interest in Loraine Kramer's story showed that, years after 
the accident, people were still interested in the Titanic. The 
world saw one world war and then another, and the great ship 
lay in darkness at the bottom of the Atlantic. But many People 
dreamed of finding the Titanic again.

The ocean was 4,000 meters (13,120 feet) deep where the 
Titanic lay. The water was black. Some people tried to find 
the ship, but without success. 
In 1985, Robert Ballard and Jean Jarry were looking for the 
ship. There were twenty-three crew and twenty-three scientists 
on their ship, the Knorr.  The team was using a submarine 
without a crew to search the bottom of the ocean. They 
worked for weeks and found nothing. 
Then, on September 1, they saw pieces of metal on the 
ocean floor. Soon they couldn't believe what the camera was 
showing them. There was a big, dark shape in the water. It 
was the front part of the Titanic! The crew and scientists of 
the Knorr were silent for a minute, as they remembered the 
dead of the Titanic. 
When the ship was discovered, some of the mysteries of the 
Titanic were solved: 
? The front part of the ship lay 600 meters (1,970 feet) from 
the back. So the Titanic did break in two as it sank. Before 
the ship was discovered, people weren't sure about this. 
? The ship sank 21 kilometers (13 miles) from the position 
that Jack Phillips and Harold Bride gave on the radio. 
Ballard and his team returned the next year to look at more of 
the ship. All of the wood was gone, but some things on the 
ship looked almost new. Ballard's pictures of the Titanic 
became very famous. But Ballard didn't bring anything up 
from the Titanic. He wanted to leave it all at the bottom of the 
ocean. 
In 1987, the ship was visited by a team with a different 
idea. This time the scientists went down in the submarine. 
They brought 1,800 things up from the Titanic. A box from 
the ship was even opened on a French TV show. It was empty.

When James Cameron was writing the movie Titanic,  he 
wanted to show the rich history of the ship and its many true 
stories. He soon became sure of one thing. The love story 
between Rose and Jack was the most important part of the 
movie. If people worry about the two young lovers, they will 
understand the disaster more. 
The movie's story doesn't begin in 1912. It starts in the 
present day, when Rose DeWitt Bukater is old. She thinks back 
to the past. The camera shows us the young Rose, when she 
sees the Titanic for the first time. 
 
Rose DeWitt Bukater is getting on the Titanic in Southampton. "It doesn't look 
any bigger than the Mauritania" she says, speaking about another famous ship. 
? British actress Kate Winslet played the young Rose, unhappy 
at the thought of her future with rich Cal Hockley (Billy 
Zane).

? Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line, and 
Thomas Andrews, the builder of the ship 
? Jack Phillips and Harold Bride in the radio room 
In the movie, Jack Dawson says that the cold water feels like 
"knives." These words come from one of the real survivors. 
Cameron read what many of the survivors wrote about 
Titanic.  He used some of their words when he wrote the 
movie. It was important to James Cameron to show these real 
people. He carefully planned the story so everything happened 
in the movie at exactly the right time. Try watching 
Cameron's movie again after reading this book. Can you see 
 
all of the things that are true?
But there are some mistakes in every movie. While Jack and 
Rose are walking on the deck, you can see a small hill with a 
building on it behind Jack. But they are in the middle of the 
Atlantic Ocean! 
As Rose finishes her story to Brock Lovett and his crew, the 
last line of her story is, "He exists now only in my memory." 
Later, she throws the Heart of the Ocean into the Atlantic. At 
the very end of the movie, we see Rose back on the Titanic. 
She is young again, and Jack Dawson is waiting for her. The 
two are together again. James Cameron says that people 
always ask him about this. Is Rose dreaming or is she dead? 
Cameron's answer? "You decide."

"The world woke up . . ."
 
After Cameron's movie, more and more people became 
interested in the story of the Titanic. Every year there are
 
more and more books and videos on the subject.
 
But why? After so many years, why are people still
 
interested in the Titanic? There have been worse accidents on
 
 
the ocean in the years since then. What is so special about
the Titanic?
 
?
 
 
Some people think that the sinking of the Titanic showed
the end of one part of history and the start of another. Before
 
the Titanic sank, it was a time of great hope. People felt good
 
 
about the world's future. Buildings were becoming taller,
machines were becoming faster, and, of course, ships were
 
becoming bigger and bigger. Anything seemed possible.
 
 
?
For many people, that dream of a wonderful future sank 
with the Titanic. After April 15, 1912, the world seemed a 
different place. Just two years later-the First World War 
 
began. Millions of people died. New machines were used to
 
kill more and more people.
?
 
Maybe Titanic survivor Jack Thayer was right when he 
wrote, "The world woke up on April 15, 1912."
