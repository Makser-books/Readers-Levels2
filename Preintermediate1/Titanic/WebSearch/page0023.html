Morse code  Morse code SOS  CQD The two men bravely stayed in the room until it was almost the end. Their last message was sent at 2:17  . .. Outside on A M  the deck, hope was growing. Captain Smith and Fourth Officer Boxhall could see the lights of a ship that was only 9.5—16 kilometers (6—10 miles) away. The crew tried to send a message to the ship with a light. Then, at 12:45  . ., they A M  began to send rockets high into the dark sky. They sent a rocket every five minutes. At first, the ship seemed to be coming closer. But then its lights disappeared. Hopes of help for the Titanic disappeared with them. What was the ship that was so close? Why didn't it help? ? Some people think that it was the Californian. In fact, the crew of the Californian did see lights in the sky and the lights of a ship. But the ship seemed quite small to them. When they tried to send a message to it, there was no answer. ? Did the officers on the Titanic see a different ship? More and more people today think that it was a Norwegian fishing boat. Why didn't it help? Maybe it was breaking the law by being in the area.  17
