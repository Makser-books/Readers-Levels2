An Unbelievable Story Alice Cleaver was a nurse, traveling on the Titanic  with a family in first class. The Allisons didn't know that, years earlier, Alice killed her own child. But now, she was helping to look after the Allisons' two children, Trevor and Loraine. On the night of the accident, the Allisons went on deck. Alice Cleaver acted quickly. She picked up the baby, Trevor. "I won't let him out of my arms," she told the boy's mother. Then she left and found a lifeboat. After she got on the Carpathia,  she kept Trevor Allison with her. All the newspapers called her very brave. But the Allison family thought that Trevor's parents died on the ship because they were looking for their son. Their other baby, Loraine, died with them. Was Alice Cleaver using Trevor to save herself? It is true that people with babies got into lifeboats more easily. Years later, the mystery about Alice Cleaver and the Allison family became even stranger. In 1940, an American woman, Loraine Kramer, spoke on the radio. Her story was hard to believe. She was Loraine Allison! This was her story: A man on the Titanic carried her into a lifeboat. This man was the ship's builder, Thomas Andrews! He and Loraine lived together in America. Sometimes Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line, visited them. He wanted them to hide because they knew important secrets about the Titanic. Kramer was probably not Loraine Allison. She was probably looking for money. In fact, many people think that Alice Cleaver helped her with information about the real Loraine Allison. Interest in Loraine Kramer's story showed that, years after the accident, people were still interested in the Titanic. The world saw one world war and then another, and the great ship lay in darkness at the bottom of the Atlantic. But many People dreamed of finding the Titanic again.                                                          33
