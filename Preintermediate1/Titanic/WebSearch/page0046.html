Jack Dawson, Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Cal Hockley weren't real people, but many of the people in the movie did exist.  The movie shows:? Captain Smith and most of the ship's officers ? first-class passengers Molly Brown and Benjamin Guggenheim ? Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line, and Thomas Andrews, the builder of the ship ? Jack Phillips and Harold Bride in the radio room In the movie, Jack Dawson says that the cold water feels like "knives." These words come from one of the real survivors. Cameron read what many of the survivors wrote about Titanic.  He used some of their words when he wrote the movie. It was important to James Cameron to show these real people. He carefully planned the story so everything happened in the movie at exactly the right time. Try watching Cameron's movie again after reading this book. Can you see  all of the things that are true?But there are some mistakes in every movie. While Jack and Rose are walking on the deck, you can see a small hill with a building on it behind Jack. But they are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean! As Rose finishes her story to Brock Lovett and his crew, the last line of her story is, "He exists now only in my memory." Later, she throws the Heart of the Ocean into the Atlantic. At the very end of the movie, we see Rose back on the Titanic. She is young again, and Jack Dawson is waiting for her. The two are together again. James Cameron says that people always ask him about this. Is Rose dreaming or is she dead? Cameron's answer? "You decide." 40
