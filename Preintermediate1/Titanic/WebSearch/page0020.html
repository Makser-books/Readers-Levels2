“Women and children first!” After Smith gave the order, the crew started to wake the passengers. They told them to put on their lifebelts and warm clothes. Passengers should go to the boat deck. At first, many of them didn't believe the danger—of course, the Titanic  couldn't sink! Some of the first lifeboats were almost empty. There were twelve people in one boat for seventy people. As the front end of the Titanic sank lower and lower in the water, more passengers began to understand the danger. But they still didn't know the most terrible fact of all. There were more than 2,200 people on the Titanic, but the ship had lifeboats for only 1,178! Parents said goodbye to their children. Husbands kissed their wives for the last time. One woman's husband told her, "You go. 1 will stay." The lifeboat left, and she never saw him again. ? First-class passenger "Molly Brown was put into the third lifeboat and she helped to get the boat away from the ship. Later, she saved a dying man, keeping him warm with her coat. ? An old woman, Mrs. Ida Straus, decided not to go into a lifeboat. She couldn't leave her husband. "We have lived together and we will die together," she said. ? One man put on women's clothes and tried to get into a lifeboat. The officer sent him away angrily. ? Third-class passenger Minnie Coutts didn't have enough lifebelts for her two sons. One of the crew gave his lifebelt to her. "There!" he said. "If the boat goes down, you'll remember me!"    14
