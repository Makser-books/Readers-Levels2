The Queen of the Ocean The  Titanic  was able to carry more than 3,000 people, but there were only 2,207 people on the ship for its first trip.       First class: 322 passengers Second class: 275 passengers                                     Third class: 712 passengers               Crew: 898 people                                          The different classes didn't mix on the ship. They slept, lived, and ate on different decks. Of course, the first-class passengers were on the higher decks. The second-class passengers were in the middle. Then came the third-class passengers, at the bottom. First Class The White Star Line called the Titanic  "the Queen of the Ocean." For first-class passengers, life on the Titanic was as comfortable as life in the most expensive hotels in Europe and America. There were hundreds of servants to look after them. Their private rooms were large and comfortable. They could enjoy a swimming pool, a library, Turkish baths, and excellent restaurants and bars. Some of the richest people in the world were on the ship. In fact, American John Jacob Astor IV was possibly the richest of all. In 1912 he had $87 million. (That is more than  $1,500,000,000 today.)Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line and  Thomas Andrews, the ship's builder, were also on the Titanic.Second Class Life for the passengers in second class was comfortable, too. In fact, second class on the Titanic was as nice as first-class travel on many other ships. These passengers also had a library and a few bars. They, too, could walk around on an open deck and enjoy views of the ocean. 8
