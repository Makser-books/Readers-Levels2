Who lived and who died? ? Bruce Ismay, the president of the White Star Line, escaped in one of the last lifeboats. ? Thomas Andrews, the ship's builder, died with the ship. He never even put his lifebelt on. ? Captain Smith didn't survive. There was a newspaper story about him saving a baby in the water. It probably wasn't true. ? Harold Bride lived. He even worked in the radio room as the Carpathia sailed to New York. ? Jack Phillips wasn't as lucky as Bride. He swam to a lifeboat but died of cold in the night. ? Second Officer Charles Lightoller survived. He was the last survivor who climbed onto the Carpathia. ? Wallace Hartley and the musicians in his band went down with the ship. ? Molly Brown lived and became famous for her bravery on the night of the disaster. In 1960 there was even a musical play about her, The Unsinkable Molly Brown. ? Jack Thayer found his mother on the Carpathia. His father died on the Titanic. He later wrote a letter to Milton Long's parents, describing their son's last hours alive.
