INTRODUCTION Parents said goodbye to their children. Husbands kissed their wives for the last time. One woman's husband told her, "You go. I will stay." The lifeboat left, and she never saw him again. There were many examples of bravery on the Titanic  on the night of April 14, 1912. Some of the crew and passengers worked all night to save other people. They chose to stay on the ship until the end. Other passengers thought only about saving themselves. They fought to get into the lifeboats. Some people think that the Titanic showed people at their best and at their worst. Maybe this is why the disaster is still famous. The ship sank in the North Atlantic over seventy-five years ago. But almost everybody in the world today knows the name of the Titanic. So what really happened that night? Why did the ship hit an iceberg? Why didn't another ship save the passengers? How many people survived, and how many died? You will find the answers in this book. But remember that the disaster is more than just a story in a history book. It happened a long time ago, but some old people today can still remember it. There were many kinds of people on the ship—rich and poor, young and old. Each person had hopes and dreams. When the ship sank, hundreds died. Their hopes and dreams died with them.  Paul Shipton lives and works in the United States and writes mostly for younger people. Ghost in the Guitar is another of his Penguin Readers.  iv
