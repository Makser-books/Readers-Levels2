"That ship is going to sink!" Can some people see the future? Can dreams ever show what is going to happen? A few strange things happened before the Titanic sailed for the first time in 1912. Strange Books ? In 1898, "Morgan Robertson wrote a book called Futility, or The Wreck on the Titan. The book told the story of a ship crossing the Atlantic. It hit an iceberg and sank. Almost all of the passengers died because there weren't enough lifeboats. ? Six years earlier, in 1892, William T. Stead wrote From the Old World to the New. In that story, too, a ship hit an iceberg and sank. Another ship picked up the survivors. The captain's name was E. J. Smith—the name of the Titanic's captain. Twenty years later, Stead traveled on the real Titanic. He didn't survive. Dreams and Bad Feelings ? The Adelmans were planning to return to America on the Titanic. Suddenly, Mrs. Adelman had a terrible feeling of danger. She and her husband didn't travel on the Titanic. ? Mrs. Blanche Marshall watched the Titanic from an island near Southampton. "That ship is going to sink before it reaches America," she said. "1 can see hundreds of people in the icy water." The Titanic left Southampton, on the south coast of England, at noon on April 10, 1912. Even at the start of the trip, the Titanic had bad luck. There was almost an accident in the first minutes of the trip. The danger passed, but for some people this was a bad start to the famous ship's first trip across the Atlantic. Some people said, "It's bad luck!"   6
